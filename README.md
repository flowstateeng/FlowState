# FlowState UI
A super minimalistic combined UI framework &amp; state management engine I developed, based on React &amp; Redux. The minimalistic nature is designed for:

1. Extremely fast load times in web browsers.
2. Easily constructing new custom UI modules.
3. Adaptive for any device or screen type.
4. Porting to other languages like Java and Python for non-web applications.

The state management portion can also be used alone to simplify CLI applications, backend services, and other contexts where a UI is not required or wanted.

See [Components](https://github.com/johnathanalyst/FlowState/tree/master#components) below for details.
See [chivington.github.io](https://chivington.github.io) for a demo.

## Prerequisites
  * Any web server.
<br/><br/>


## Installation
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/johnathanalyst/FlowState.git
```

That's it!
<br/>


## Usage
This repository contains a fully functional starter web app, which consists of the FlowState UI framework and the basic modules needed to construct a web app skeleton.

To begin building your own web app from this repository, simply clone this repository into the directory your server will serve from. That's all you need to do! Any choice of web server should work just fine, and begin serving your new FlowState web app immediately!

## Components
The FlowState UI framework itself consists of:

1. A barebones UI generation component inspired by React.
2. A state management engine inspired by Redux.


However, this repository also contains other items needed to create a basic web app using the FlowState UI framework. These include:

1. A few views most websites typically contain (Home, About, Contact, etc.).
2. A few custom modules most web apps typically contain (Header, Menu, Footer, Router, etc.)
3. A font directory containing one font I like (typically used on iOS devices)
4. A directory of placeholder images & icons.
5. A few items needed to make your web app function as a native app when added to a mobile homescreen (browserconfig.xml, site.webmanifest)
